# PAC-Learning 

Most reconstruction-based multivariate time series anomaly detection methods assume that training data are clean and ignore the characteristics of anomalous data. They often suffer from the overgeneralization problem during the reconstruction process. To address these problems, dual-memory augmentation assisted contrastive learning for multivariate time series anomaly detection (shorted as PAC-Learning) is proposed.
